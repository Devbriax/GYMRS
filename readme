### 5.3 Frontend Technology Options

### Option 1: Traditional Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

**Technologies:**

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 (with potential preprocessors like SASS or LESS)
- Vanilla JavaScript or jQuery
- Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive design

**Advantages:**

- Lightweight and fast initial load times
- No additional build complexity
- Direct integration with Laravel Blade templates
- Lower learning curve for developers familiar with traditional web development

### Option 2: React Frontend

**Technologies:**

- React.js for component-based UI
- Create React App or Vite for project setup
- Redux or Context API for state management
- Axios for API interactions
- Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for styling

**Advantages:**

- Component-based architecture
- Enhanced user interactivity
- More robust state management
- Easier to maintain for complex interactions
- Better performance for dynamic content

**Frontend Requirements (Applicable to Both Options):**

- Responsive design that works across devices
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Clean and intuitive user experience
- Consistent design language
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility considerations

### Frontend-Backend Integration Approach

- For HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Direct integration with Laravel Blade templates
- For React:
- Use Laravel as a backend API
- Implement JWT or Sanctum for authentication
- Create separate frontend and backend repositories

## 6. Additional Considerations

### 6.1 Compliance and Data Protection

- GDPR compliance
